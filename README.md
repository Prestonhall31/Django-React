Collaborative Music Playing System

I am creating this app to improve my skills with Python, and become more familiar with Django while integrating React.js. 

This app will allow 1 host to create a room in Spotify, then give a code to a bunch of people to join a room. The guests will be able to listen to and even control the music based on the host's permissions.

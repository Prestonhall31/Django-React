Collaborative Music Playing System

I am creating this app to improve my skills with Python, and become more familiar with Django while integrating React.js. 

This app will allow 1 host to create a room in Spotify, then give a code to a bunch of people to join a room. The guests will be able to listen to and even control the music based on the host's permissions.

Windows venv activation
To activate your venv on Windows, you need to run a script that gets installed by venv. If you created your venv in a directory called myenv, the command would be:

# In cmd.exe
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# In PowerShell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
